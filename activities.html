            <h2>Surfing</h2>

            <img src="surf.jpg" alt="surfing" height="200" width="300" class="align" >
               
             <p>Surfing in Sri Lanka is a nice mix of travel adventure, beautiful beaches, and wonderful surf.  The surf conditions in Sri Lanka are not as 
            consistent as say Bali, but there are almost always surf waves somewhere in Sri Lanka.<br><br>
            The main surfing season for the south is from November to May – that’s when the waves are utter perfection. The best season on the east coast is from 
            April to October, when the waves are longer. Here’s what you need to know: there will always be waves somewhere.<br><br>

            The main patches for surfing are the southwest, south and east coasts. The most famous areas are Unawatuna and Hikkaduwa in the southwest, 
            Weligama in the south and Arugam Bay in the east. All areas have popular as well as more hidden spots. The waves in Sri Lanka are not the giant kind 
            like those in Hawaii or Western Australia, they are smaller and longer; one wave in Okanda (on the east coast) can be surfed for as long as 60 seconds 
            if your legs can handle it.</p>
